# About

In this project, we explore the concepts introduced in [Think Python, 2nd edition][think-py-2e]
which is the latest version of [How Think Like a Computer Scientist][how-to-think-like-a-cs]
with the `turtle` module as introduced in [Chapter 4][think-py-turtle-intro] of
[Think Python][think-py-2e-html].

Key Objectives are as follows
* Visual summary of various concepts for better retention
* Concise Summaries of concepts for experienced programmers
* Augment the course material provided by [Think Python, 2nd edition][think-py-2e]
